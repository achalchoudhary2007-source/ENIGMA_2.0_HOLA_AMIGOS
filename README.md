 The “ML Learning Sandbox”: Interactive Machine Learning Simulator
The Problem:
Machine Learning concepts such as gradient descent, decision boundaries, overfitting, and
neural network training are difficult for students to understand through theory alone. Most
platforms require heavy coding setup, creating a barrier for beginners.
The Challenge:
Build an Interactive Machine Learning Simulator that allows students to experiment with ML
algorithms visually — adjusting parameters, observing training behavior, and understanding
model performance without writing complex code.
Deliverables:
• Interactive ML playground web app
• Visual explanation modules for core algorithms
• Sample guided learning scenarios
• Architecture diagram of simulation pipeline
